# Goodbye New York. Hello, Singapore!

A few days ago we packed everything up and said goodbye to our studio in New York. We flew 12 hours to Dubai and then 7 more hours to Singapore. Casey will be here full time for her Master’s at NUS, and I’ll be visiting here as much as I can, with periodic trips back to Boston.

Since a bunch of people have asked us about the move and what the campus and our new living situation is like, we figured we’d chronicle it all here in one place.

There you have it! We’re just getting settled in now, but so far we’re loving it. Casey begins her program in a week.
